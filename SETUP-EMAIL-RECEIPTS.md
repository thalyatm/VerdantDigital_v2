# Email Receipts Setup Guide (Vercel)

This guide will help you configure email receipts for all form submissions to be sent to `thalya@verdantlabs.com.au`.

## Overview

Your application now has three Vercel Serverless Functions that handle form submissions and payment receipts:

1. **create-checkout-session.js** - Handles Stripe payment checkout sessions
2. **stripe-webhook.js** - Listens for successful payments and sends receipt emails via Resend
3. **contact-form.js** - Handles contact form submissions and sends notifications via Resend

All emails are automatically sent to: **thalya@verdantlabs.com.au**

## Setup Steps

### 1. Configure Resend

1. Go to [https://resend.com](https://resend.com) and sign up for a free account
2. Verify your email address
3. Add your sending domain (verdantdigital.com.au):
   - Go to Domains → Add Domain
   - Add the required DNS records to your domain provider
   - Wait for verification (usually takes a few minutes)
4. Generate an API key:
   - Go to API Keys → Create API Key
   - Copy the key (starts with `re_`)
   - Save it for the next step

**Note:** Until your domain is verified, Resend will send emails from a generic domain. For testing, you can send to verified email addresses only.

### 2. Configure Stripe

#### 2.1 Get Stripe API Keys

1. Go to [https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)

### 3. Configure Environment Variables in Vercel
