            <p className="mb-2"><strong>3.2 Monthly Fee:</strong> The $99 monthly fee is charged automatically via direct debit or credit card on the same date each month. The first monthly fee is charged in the month following your website launch. For example, if your website goes live in December 2025, your first $99 monthly payment will be charged in January 2026, and your 24-month contract will end in January 2028.</p>
            <p className="mb-2"><strong>3.3 Failed Payments:</strong> If a monthly payment fails, we will attempt to contact you and retry payment. Services may be suspended after 14 days of non-payment.</p>
            <p className="mb-2"><strong>3.4 Price Changes:</strong> Monthly fees are fixed for the duration of the 24-month contract period. After the contract period, fees may be adjusted with 30 days' written notice.</p>

            <p className="mb-2"><strong>4.2 Third-Party Collection:</strong> We reserve the right to engage third-party debt collection agencies to recover outstanding amounts. You will be responsible for all reasonable costs associated with debt recovery, including but not limited to collection agency fees, legal fees, and administrative charges.</p>
            <p className="mb-2"><strong>4.3 Credit Reporting:</strong> We may report payment defaults and outstanding debts to credit reporting bureaus in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Privacy (Credit Reporting) Code. This may negatively impact your credit rating and ability to obtain credit in the future.</p>
            <p className="mb-2"><strong>4.4 Interest on Overdue Amounts:</strong> Overdue amounts may accrue interest at a rate of 2% per month (or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower) from the due date until payment is received in full.</p>

              <li>Continue on a month-to-month basis at $50/month (hosting and security only)</li>

            <p className="mb-2"><strong>5.3 Early Termination:</strong> If you wish to terminate this Agreement before the 24-month period, you may buy out the remaining contract balance. The buyout amount is calculated as the number of months remaining multiplied by $99, similar to a phone plan contract.</p>

We reserve the right to determine what constitutes reasonable use based on the time and complexity involved. Minor changes that take 10-20 minutes are expected and welcomed. However, excessive requests that require significant ongoing time commitment (for example, 20+ substantial changes per month requiring 30+ minutes each) may be deemed to exceed the value of the $99 monthly fee and could incur additional charges or be deferred to the following month.</p>
            <p className="mb-2"><strong>8.4 Major Changes:</strong> Significant structural changes, additional pages beyond the initial five, or new functionality may incur additional costs, which will be quoted before work commences.</p>
