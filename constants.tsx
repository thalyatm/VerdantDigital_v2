  {
    question: "I'm not tech savvy, can I still work with you?",
    answer: "Yes. You don't need to manage anything technical. You simply send us updates and we take care of them for you."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to go live?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Your website is typically ready within 7 calendar days of getting started, depending on how quickly feedback is provided after the staging preview. See our <a href="/tradie/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-brand-accent hover:underline">Terms & Conditions (Section 6)</a> for full timeline details.
      </>
    )
  },
  {
    question: "Will this help me get more work, or just look better?",
    answer: "The structure, wording and layout are designed to increase enquiries, build trust and make customers choose you over competitors."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to advertise, or will people find me naturally?",
    answer: "Your site is built Google-friendly, but organic rankings take time. If you want leads faster, the optional advertising add-on can accelerate results."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't have photos or wording?",
    answer: (
      <>
        No problem. We can create the copy and source stock imagery for you. If you send photos later, we'll swap them in at no extra cost. Note: This doesn't include logo design or custom photography. See <a href="/tradie/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-brand-accent hover:underline">Terms & Conditions (Section 7)</a> for details.
      </>
    )
  },
  {
    question: "What if I already have a website?",
    answer: "We can replace it and transfer your domain with no hassle. If you prefer, we can build privately first and switch it over once approved."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to manage the website myself?",
    answer: (
      <>
        No. We manage updates, changes, optimisation and hosting. You focus on the work, we handle the website. Learn more in our <a href="/tradie/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-brand-accent hover:underline">Terms & Conditions (Section 8)</a>.
      </>
    )
  },
  {
    question: "What happens after launch?",
    answer: (
      <>
        You continue to receive hosting, updates, mobile optimisation and priority support as part of your monthly plan. Full details in our <a href="/tradie/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-brand-accent hover:underline">Terms & Conditions (Sections 5 & 12)</a>.
      </>
    )
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any hidden costs?",
    answer: (
      <>
        No. The only costs are the $399 setup fee and the $99/month ongoing fee for 24 months. Optional extras, like advertising, additional pages, or logo design, are quoted only if requested. See <a href="/tradie/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-brand-accent hover:underline">Terms & Conditions (Section 11)</a> for what's not included.
      </>
    )
  },
  {
    question: "Can I take my website with me in the future?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Yes. After 24 months, you own the website and can continue month-to-month at $50/mo (hosting and security only) or take your website files to another provider at no cost. If you need to exit earlier, you can buy out the remaining contract balance (number of months remaining x $99). Full details in our <a href="/tradie/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-brand-accent hover:underline">Terms & Conditions (Sections 5 & 10)</a>.

        question: "How much does a website cost?",

        question: "How long does a project take?",

      {
        question: "Do we need to maintain the website ourselves?",
