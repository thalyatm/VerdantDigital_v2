## Core FAQs

### What does Verdant Digital actually do?
We design and build websites and digital platforms that help businesses operate with more clarity, efficiency and momentum. Our work focuses on usability, structure, performance and outcomes, not just visual presentation.

### Who is Verdant Digital for?
We work with small to mid-sized businesses, professional services, trade businesses and growing brands that want digital solutions that are easy to use, simple to manage and designed to support real business growth.

### How much does a website cost?
Pricing depends on scope, complexity and required functionality. Smaller business websites start at an accessible entry price, while more advanced platforms and e-commerce builds require deeper planning. We provide fixed pricing once requirements are defined.

### How long does a project take?
A typical website build takes between 3 and 8 weeks depending on the size of the site, content readiness and required features. More complex platforms may take longer, but you see progress throughout the build.

### Do you offer ongoing support after launch?
Yes. We provide hosting, maintenance, optimisation and refinements based on real-world performance and user behaviour, so your digital solution continues to improve over time.

## Process-Related FAQs

### What do you need from us to get started?
We begin with a discussion about your goals, audience, content and requirements. If you do not have this defined, we guide you through it.

### Can you help with content and wording?
Yes. We write or refine copy to ensure clarity, structure and usability, and to reduce cognitive load for your users.

### Do we need to maintain the website ourselves?
No. We manage the platform, updates and improvements for you. You do not need technical skills or extra admin. You focus on the business, and we keep the digital side running properly.

### Do we get to see work in progress?
Yes. You see working outputs early so there are no surprises and feedback can be incorporated throughout the build.

### What if we don't know exactly what we need yet?
Part of our process is helping businesses define the right solution so they are not over-building or under-building.
